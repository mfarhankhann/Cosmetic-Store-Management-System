# Cosmetic Shop Management System
we are doing our project on Cosmetic Shop Management. There is a need for effecitve and efficient management of a network based system for handling customer orders.
This project is an endeavor to provide a solution to this. The proposed system enables an administrator to keep track of customer orders and maintaining records of the customers. He can view the submitted requirements made by the customer. He can also generate reports and can also send approvals or rejections instantly.Thus the project is a sincere effort in simplifying the task of administrators in an easily usable format.
